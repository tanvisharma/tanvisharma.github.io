I am a final year PhD student in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University. I joined Purdue for a Direct PhD program in 2019 under the supervision of [Prof. Kaushik Roy](https://engineering.purdue.edu/NRL). Broadly, my research interests are in problems that intersect deep learning and hardware systems. The focus of my thesis is two-fold, 1. architecting efficient compute-in-memory based hardware solutions for deep learning (HW4DL), and 2. leveraging deep learning for hardware design (DL4HW).
 
Prior to joining Purdue, I worked as Digital Design Engineer in the Backplane Team at Texas Instruments (TI) India where I also collaborated with the EDA team, thanks to my manager Rashmi Sachan.

Beyond research, I like listening to music, dancing, solving NYT puzzles and finding guinea pigs for my cooking experiments. I also love playing badminton and have won several awards at intra- and inter- college tournaments during my undergrad at Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee.
